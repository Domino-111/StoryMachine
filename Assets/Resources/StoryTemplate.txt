Once upon a time, there was a /noun/ called /~name/. /~/ was the /adjective (description)/ type, so one day, they went down to the /place/ for a long, /adjective/ /activity/.

But it was not meant to be. A /adjective/ /noun/ came out of nowhere, and suddenly started /verb (-ing)/! It was all too much, so they decided to go home.

Just when they thought they were free to start /verb (-ing)/, though, it started to rain /plural noun/, and before they knew it, their /object/ was full of /plural noun/.

Their day was totally /adjective/.
